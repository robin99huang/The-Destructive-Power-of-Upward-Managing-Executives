# A Cautionary Tale from an Open Source Company



*A reflection on management risks in open source business*ï¼Œbeware of Upward-Managing Executives and Their Organizational Damage

## Background

It's been a while since I left my previous company. Recently, during a conversation with a former sales colleague, I heard some shocking stories. As I'm planning to venture into open source business myself, I feel compelled to document this experience. The company in question is a well-known open source messaging middleware vendor in China, with over 100 employees and tens of millions in revenue. The founding team promoted a sales director with multinational corporation background to VP of Sales to manage overall sales operations. Little did they know this decision would prove devastatingly destructive.

## The Hiring Perspective

In theory, years of multinational sales management experience should bring valuable customer resources, channel relationships, and industry insights - all crucial for open source commercialization. Unfortunately, they hired someone from Oracle, whose sales model focused on fighting piracy. This person lacked genuine customer resources and industry insight. Moreover, this type of sales executive typically maintains an aggressive stance toward customers, excels at managing upward, operates without ethical boundaries, and is experienced in money-making schemes through channel/customer collusion.

## Strategic Control Tactics

To maximize personal gain while maintaining complete control over sales, this VP implemented several cunning strategies:

* Seized control of sales lead distribution
* Bypassed middle management to directly control sales team
* Conducted one-on-one PUA-style meetings to reinforce power
* Orchestrated character assassination of sales staff through other departments
* Demanded kickbacks from sales commissions through lead control
* Convinced management that sales team was incompetent while taking credit for successes
* Dismantled pricing system by requiring personal approval for all quotes
* Gained absolute control over partner approvals
* Manipulated price increases to curry favor with upper management while disregarding market impact

The destructive power of one individual proved immense - internally replacing good talent with mediocrity while externally damaging the company's reputation.

## Preventive Measures

While these manipulative tactics are sophisticated, there are ways to identify and prevent such destructive management:

* Evaluate management motives and rationality

* Assess problem identification and solution implementation

* Evaluate actual execution and results beyond presentations

* Distribute management authority to prevent power concentration

* Implement collaborative pricing systems between product and sales teams

* Establish role-specific evaluation criteria

* Focus on actions rather than words (first principles)

* Maintain open information flow and multiple feedback channels

## Conclusion

This case demonstrates how seemingly professional management can mask deeply destructive practices. For open source businesses, maintaining distributed authority, collaborative decision-making, and healthy culture is crucial for sustainable growth.

*May this lesson help others avoid similar pitfalls in their open source journey.*
